# GifMaker (Swift)

![Platform iOS](https://img.shields.io/badge/nanodegree-iOS-blue.svg)

This repository contains resources for the GifMaker (Swift) project.

## Overview

GifMaker is an app that lets users create simple GIF animations from their iOS device. It is an exercise I went through in porting an application written in Objective-C into Swift. I was also able to learn some of the interoperability challenges that exist when working with both languages.

## Setup

GifMaker should run without any additional setup.
